 ## Introduction
 
 I build this app using React, Node.js, Express & MongoDB.
 I learnt how to build a Full Stack MERN Application - from start to finish.
 
 The App is called "Memory Bank" and it is a simple social media app that allows users to post interesting events, memories or any information that they wanted to share.
 
 
 Setup:
- run ```npm i && npm start``` for both client and server side to start the app
